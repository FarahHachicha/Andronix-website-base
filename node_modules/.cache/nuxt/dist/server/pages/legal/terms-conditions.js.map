It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore\\n          recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software\\n          restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your\\n          phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it\\n          could mean that the Andronix App app won’t work properly or at all.</p> <p class=\\\"font-bold\\\" data-v-3ab44734>The app does use third party services that declare their own Terms and Conditions.\\n\\n          Link to Terms and Conditions of third party service providers used by the app</p> <ul data-v-3ab44734><li data-v-3ab44734><a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https://policies.google.com/terms\\\" class=\\\"underline text-gray-500\\\" data-v-3ab44734>Google Play Services</a></li> <li data-v-3ab44734><a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https://firebase.google.com/terms/analytics\\\" data-v-3ab44734>Google Analytics for Firebase</a></li> <li data-v-3ab44734><a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https://firebase.google.com/terms/crashlytics\\\" data-v-3ab44734>Firebase Crashlytics</a></li> <li data-v-3ab44734><a target=\\\"_blank\\\" href=\\\"https://onesignal.com/tos\\\" data-v-3ab44734>One Signal</a></li></ul> <p data-v-3ab44734>You should be aware that there are certain things that Andronix will not take responsibility for. Certain\\n          functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection can be\\n          Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but Andronix cannot take responsibility for the app not\\n          working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data\\n          allowance left.</p> <p data-v-3ab44734>If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the agreement\\n          with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider\\n          for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other third party\\n          charges. In using the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data\\n          charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data\\n          roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the app, please be aware that we\\n          assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the app.</p> <p data-v-3ab44734>Along the same lines, Andronix cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need\\n          to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail\\n          the Service, Andronix cannot accept responsibility.</p> <p data-v-3ab44734>With respect to Andronix’s responsibility for your use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s\\n          important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times,\\n          we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. Andronix\\n          accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this\\n          functionality of the app.</p> <p data-v-3ab44734>At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on Android – the requirements\\n          for system (and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change,\\n          and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app. Andronix does not promise that it\\n          will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android version that you have\\n          installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to\\n          you, We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving\\n          notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and\\n          licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it\\n          from your device.</p> <p class=\\\"font-bold text-lg text-white my-3\\\" data-v-3ab44734>Changes to This Terms and Conditions</p> <p data-v-3ab44734>We may update our Terms and Conditions from time to time.
