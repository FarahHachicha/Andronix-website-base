The email and password are all stored encrypted safely.\n          We do not store your emails on a separate database, which throws the possibilities to have breach in the\n          database due to poor security rules. Authentication is handled by Google’s own <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://firebase.google.com/products/auth\" data-v-de9674d8>Firebase Authentication</a>.

Note - This is only applicable to the systems that we\n          operate and have under control and does not include any of the external services that we use or might use in\n          the future. As an example, if you use a Google service and have a Google account prior to using Andronix,\n          there's a good chance that Google might track you inside Andronix as well with all the Firebase products\n          that we use.</p> <p class=\"font-bold\" data-v-de9674d8>In a nutshell, the fore-mentioned policies of handling your data is only applicable\n          within our systems.
